# RSA-algorithm

Simple RSA algorithm

The objective of this project is to understand and implement RSA algorithm without using readymade modules. The program is impelemented using Python which takes parameters (N, e or d, m or c) and the message from the user.

Their are two parts in this project:
1. Encryption/decryption
Write a function to encrypt or decrypt the message that is passed by the user using square and multiply.



2. Signature/verification
Write a function to sign or verify messages from the user by using square and multiply. (simply pass to
the function (N, d or e, m or sig) parameters and using the already selected parameters (N, e, and d) by the user.

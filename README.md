# RSA-algorithm

Simple RSA algorithm

The objective of this project is to understand and implement RSA algorithm without using readymade modules. The program is impelemented using Python which randomly selects two prime numbers, denoted by p and q (16 bits each) and compute the parameters (N, e or d, m or c). After computing the values of the parameters it will use them to apply RSA encryption/decryption on the user's message.

There are two parts in this project:
1. Encryption/decryption
Write a function to encrypt/decrypt the message that is passed by the user using square and multiply.



2. Signature/verification
Write a function to sign or verify message from the user by using square and multiply. (simply pass to
the function (N, d or e, m or sig) parameters and using the already selected parameters (N, e, and d) by the user.
